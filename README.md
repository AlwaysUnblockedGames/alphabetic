# Alphabetic Exploit
This is a cloaking proxy launcher targeted at Hapara Highlights and Hapara Filter. It can open unfiltered tabs that are invisible on the teacher dashboard.

It will likely also work with other Chrome web filters and monitoring software, as well as with most network-wide filters.

To use it, go to [xlak.github.io/alphabetic](https://xlak.github.io/alphabetic)

# Notice about the proxy servers

The main proxy server is currently experiencing a strange issue where elements on a page fail to load properly. For now, use a proxy with cloaking support instead.
